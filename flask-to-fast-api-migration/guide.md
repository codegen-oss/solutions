# Guide: Migrating from Flask to FastAPI with Codegen

This guide walks you through the steps to migrate your codebase from Flask to FastAPI using Codegen. Follow along to modernize your static file handling, template syntax, and routes while ensuring compatibility with FastAPI. Each step includes a direct link to the appropriate codemod for easy implementation.

## How to Migrate

### Step 1: Migrate Static File Handling

FastAPI uses a different approach for serving static files. Use the static file handling codemod to:

- Update your static file serving logic to align with FastAPI's methods.

### Step 2: Refactor Template Syntax

Refactor your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure compatibility with FastAPI. This includes:

- Updating template rendering logic.
- Ensuring all template syntax is compatible with FastAPI.

ðŸ‘‰ [Run the Template Syntax Codemod](https://www.codegen.sh/search/6750?skillType=codemod)

### Step 3: Enhance Migration Feedback

Improve the feedback you receive during the migration process. This helps in tracking progress and debugging issues.

### Step 4: Migrate Flask Routes

FastAPI has a different routing system compared to Flask. Use the route migration codemod to:

- Convert Flask routes to FastAPI routes.
- Ensure all route handlers are updated to FastAPI's syntax.
